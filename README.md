# gophonologue (goph-on-o-log)
I'm not very good with puns obviously.

## Deployment
```shell
# Get boltdb dependency
go get github.com/boltdb/bolt

go get github.com/george-e-shaw-iv/gophonologue
cd $GOPATH/github.com/george-e-shaw-iv/gophonologue
go run main.go
```

After it is running you can navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser.
